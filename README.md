Choice of Game: Concentration (Memory game)
Overview: Concentration the Memory Game will be specifically designed for kids and will be a display of 25+ faced down cards where kids will have the ability to use their mouse and computer to pick two cards until they match! The cards will display matching animals and there will be a timer that gives kids a heads up when they will run out of time. The faster they answer the more points they get!
This was made because of my love for animals and memorization games!
